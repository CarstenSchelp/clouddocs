# Your first virtual machine

## Introduction

This chapter teaches you how you can create a `Virtual Machine` (from now on, VM) running Linux, by importing an _appliance_ from the Marketplace. 

> **NOTE**
>
> This walk-through gives a good introduction to the concepts of the HPC Cloud, and if you are going to use a  VM running Linux for your research, this will produce a basic VM you can keep working with to install the software that you may need and where to process your data later on. Even if you are going to use a VM running Windows, this chapter still gives you a good introduction, and you are recommended to start here.
>
> More advanced and specialized topics are dicsussed separately.


## Logging into the HPC Cloud User Interface

The HPC Cloud User Interface (from now on, UI) is the web site where you manage your VMs, disks and networks. After your project is approved, you will receive a username and a password for the UI.

You can reach the UI at the following URL: https://ui.hpccloud.surfsara.nl 

> **NOTE**
>
> If you would like an explanation about the options you can see on the UI, please visit [the User Interface documentation page](user-interface).

To start building a virtual machine, go to the UI and log in with the username and password you received. 

> **NOTE**
>
> ...that the username and password are **not** for the VM you are going to create. You can set users and passwords later one, once you have created the VM.
