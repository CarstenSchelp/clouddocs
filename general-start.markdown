# Your first virtual machine

## Introduction

This chapter teaches you how you can create a Linux virtual machine by
importing an appliance from the marketplace. The walk-through gives a
good introduction to the concepts of the HPC Cloud, and if you are going
to use a Linux virtual machine for your research, this will produce a
working virtual machine for you to work with. Even if you are going to
use a Windows virtual machine, this chapter still gives you a good
introduction, and you are recommended to start here.

More advanced and specialized topics are dicsussed separately.
