# Your first virtual machine

## Introduction

This chapter teaches you how you can create a Linux virtual machine by
importing an appliance from the marketplace. The walk-through gives a
good introduction to the concepts of the HPC Cloud, and if you are going
to use a Linux virtual machine for your research, this will produce a
working virtual machine for you to work with. Even if you are going to
use a Windows virtual machine, this chapter still gives you a good
introduction, and you are recommended to start here.

More advanced and specialized topics are dicsussed separately.


## Logging in on the HPC Cloud User Interface

The user interface of the HPC Cloud is where you manage your
virtual machines, disks and networks. After your HPC Cloud project is
approved, you receive a username and a password for the HPC Cloud user
interface.

To start building a virtual machine, go to
```
   https://ui.cloud.sara.nl
```
and log in with the username and password you received. Note that the
username and password are *not* the username and password of the virtual
machine you are going to create. These you will set yourself after you
have created a virtual machine.
