## <a name="general"></a>General Information
This session is part of the Compute Track programme of the third [SURF Research Bootcamp](https://surfresearchbootcamp.nl/). Here is the agenda for the session:

> Date: 15-06-2017     
> Location: Eindhoven University of Technology

> * 10:15 - 11:30 Introduction to UNIX
> * **12:30 - 14:30 HPC Cloud** 
>     * 12:30 Presentation: HPC Cloud at SURFsara (Nuno Ferreira)   
>     * 13:00 Hands-on (Ander Astudillo, Maithili Maithili Kalamkar, Nuno Ferreira) 
>     * 14:30 End 
> * 15:00 - 17:00 Introduction to cluster computing

SURFsara has been operating the HPC Cloud as an Infrastructure as a Service (`IaaS`) since 2013.
The HPC Cloud has a powerful user interface which grants access to high-performant compute and storage nodes.
The user interface and cloud software relies on [OpenNebula](http://opennebula.org/) and the cluster of resources available is called _Oort_, after the [Oort cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud).

This particular course aims to introduce the workshop participants to the HPC Cloud by providing an introductory lecture to the service and a set hands-on exercises to be run on the _Oort_ production infrastructure.


## <a name="preparation"></a>Preparation

Participants should bring a laptop with Internet connection and a proper browser.
Prior experience in [Linux commands](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/) will help but is not a prerequisite.

So what you need for this tutorial:

* A computer with full Internet access. The room provides WiFi.
* A browser (Chrome or Firefox will do nicely).
* An SSH client.
  * Linux and Mac users: don't have to install anything. The SSH client is on board, try "ssh" in a [terminal](http://askubuntu.com/questions/38162/what-is-a-terminal-and-how-do-i-open-and-use-it).
  * Windows users: download and install [git for windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/). Depending on your OS installation, choose between the `-32-bit.exe` or the `-64-bit.exe`.


## <a name="hands-on"></a> Hands-on
The hands-on tutorial has two parts. The exercises in part *A* will give you a first grasp for the `basic` usage of HPC Cloud. Once you have completed and understood this, then continue to the *Extras* part with more `advanced` examples on the HPC Cloud.
