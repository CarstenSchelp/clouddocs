These are the extras of the Tutorial [UvA workshop 2016-01-25](UvAworkshop-2016-01-25).
**You should have completed (and understood)** [UvA workshop 2016-01-25 - Part A](UvAworkshop-2016-01-25-partA) and [UvA workshop 2016-01-25 - Part B](UvAworkshop-2016-01-25-partB),  before trying these extras.

The exersises below can be done in any order and you can do none or more, depending on your enthusiasm and available time.

You will find several _Food for brain_ questions in each exercise that you might encounter when working with _Parallelization_ techniques. Perform many tests, observe the results, think about answers.

* [OpenMP: calculating _pi_](UvAworkshop-2016-01-25-OpenMP)
  Using a simple algorithm to calculate _&pi;_ as an example, you see the impact of parallelising with OpenMP with different approaches

* [MPI: xBeach](UvAworkshop-2016-01-25-xBeach)
  XBeach is a two-dimensional model for waves hitting the shore, using MPI to parallelise the computations.
