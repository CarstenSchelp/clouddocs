# HPC Cloud documentation

> **NOTE:**
>
> This _wiki_ collects SURFsara's upcoming **new HPC Cloud** documentation. That new service is currently in **_beta_** status, and this documentation is heavily under construction. You can expect frequent changes in these pages.

## Basics

[General start](general-start)  
[User Interface](user-interface)  
[Access your Virtual Machine](access-your-VM)

## Advanced Topics

### General

Customize your Virtual Machine  
Virtual Machine from Scratch  
Contextualization  
Dynamic Virtual Machine Management  
Sharing OpenNebula Objects  
Windows  
Backup  
Licences  

### Disk Images
Scratch Disk Images  
[Download an image](image_download)  
Create an Image on your own Machine  

### Networks
Virtual Network  
Lightpaths 

### Security
> **NOTE:**
>
> You are strongly advised to set up your **own firewall** inside your virtual machines. OpenNebula offers now the so-called `Security Groups` instead of the old `Network filters`. However, they do not work in the current implementation, so we are pursuing other ways to provide a form of external firewall. 


### Inside the VM

[Grid Storage](grid-storage)  
Share Data between Virtual Machines  
Pilot Jobs
