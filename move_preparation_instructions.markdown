# HPC Cloud moves to a new datacenter

Below the announcemen you will find step-by-step instructions to prepare your HPC Cloud project for the datacenter move.

## Announcement

**The HPC Cloud will not be available from 2 to 11 September.**

During this time the HPC Cloud hardware will move to the new data center. We expect to resume normal operation on 12 September.

### What do you need to do?

Make sure that all your VMs are properly shut down: your list of VMs should be empty by the end of Thursday 1 September.
If you feel you really need to keep some VM instances, please contact our advisors to minimize the risk of data loss.

### Will my data be safe during the move?
 
We are doing everything possible to minimize the risk of data loss. 
If your VM list is empty, this risk will not be greater than during normal operation. 
Nevertheless, we always recommend users with valuable datasets to keep a copy elsewhere.

### Questions?  

Please call or email your advisor, or contact our helpdesk: helpdesk@surfsara.nl if you have questions about the move.
