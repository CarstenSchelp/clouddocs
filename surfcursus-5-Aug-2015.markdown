## <a name="general"></a>General Information 

SURFsara has been operating an HPC Cloud service for several years. Since recently we have launched a new HPC Cloud with a powerful new user interface and a complete new cluster with faster compute nodes and high-performant big storage volumes. The user interface is supported by OpenNebula 4 and our new cluster is called **`Ooort`**.

This particular course aims to introduce SURF employees to the HPC Cloud by providing a set of lectures and hands-on examples to run on the real `Oort` infrastructure.
