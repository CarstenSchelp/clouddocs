## <a name="general"></a>General Information 

SURFsara has been operating the HPC Cloud as `IaaS` (Infrastructure as a Service) for several years. Since recently we have launched a new HPC Cloud with a powerful new user interface and a complete new cluster with fast compute nodes and high-performant big storage volumes. The user interface and cloud software relies on [OpenNebula 4](http://opennebula.org/) and our new cluster is called [Oort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud).

This particular course aims to introduce SURF employees to the HPC Cloud by providing a set of lectures and hands-on examples to run on the real **`Oort`** infrastructure. Here is a summary of the course outline:

## <a name="preparation"></a>Prepare your laptop 

What you need for this tutorial:
* A computer with full Internet access.
* A browser (Chrome or Firefox will do nicely).
* Java, at least version 8 (a.k.a. 1.7)
* An SSH client.
  * Linux and Mac users don't need to install anything. The SSH client is on board, try "ssh" in a [terminal](http://askubuntu.com/questions/38162/what-is-a-terminal-and-how-do-i-open-and-use-it).
  * Windows users need to download and install [git for windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).   
* An X-window client.
  * Linux and Mac users normally don't need to install anything as X11 is on board. However, the newest Mac OS releases might not have X11.app installed. In that case, get XQuarz from [here](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/).*
  * Windows users need to install [Xming](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/).
 
## <a name="hands-on"></a> Hands-on
The hands-on tutorial has two parts. The exercises in part A will give you a first grasp for the `basic` usage of HPC Cloud. Once you have completed and understood the part A, then continue to part B with more `advanced` examples on the HPC Cloud. If you finish both part A & B and wish to know more about the HPC Cloud, try the additional exercises in `extras`.
