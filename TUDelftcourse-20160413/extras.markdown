These are the extras of the Tutorial [TUDelft course 2016-04-13](.).

**You should have completed (and understood)** [Part A](partA) and [Part B](partB), before trying these extras.

The exercises below can be done in any order and you can do none or more, depending on your enthusiasm and available time.

You will find several _Food for brain_ questions in each exercise that you might encounter when working with **Parallel programming** techniques. We advice that you perform many tests, observe the results (write down execution times, change parameters, make tables, draw graphs...), and think about your answers.

## OpenMP

Link: [OpenMP: calculating _&pi;_](OpenMP)
  
  Using a simple algorithm to calculate _&pi;_ as an example, you see the impact of **parallel programming** with OpenMP taking different approaches.

## MPI

## XBeach

Link: [MPI: xBeach](xBeach)
  
  XBeach is a two-dimensional model for waves hitting the shore, using MPI to parallelize the computations.
